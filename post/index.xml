      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just created this blog for learning pourposes. I&amp;rsquo;m going to learn a lot of things. I think this blog can help me, but also some of my learnings can help someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy it as I&amp;rsquo;m going to enjoy it, and feel free to comment, suggest or  correct any of the content I will be posting here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that everything is about learning, enjoying, sharing and teaching. No matter  yours skills, the most important is the will of learn and teach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who am I? I&amp;rsquo;m Mike, a programmer that thought, some time ago, that he already knew everything that was needed to know to be a good programmer, but now, the only thing that I&amp;rsquo;m sure is that I have a long journey. A journey to learn to be a better professional. And that journey will never end!!&lt;/p&gt;
