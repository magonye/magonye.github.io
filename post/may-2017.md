This month has been a very quiet month. No much reading.

I've just finished the "[Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/aprendiendo-a-aprender/home/welcome)" course at Coursera.

I also finished a very interesting course at Udemy: "[How to become a better developer](https://www.udemy.com/how-to-become-a-better-developer/)".

I would recommend both courses to everybody. They are clear, very well explained, and the topics are very helpfull. If you want to be a better developer and you have a lot of things to learn, you may consider to take these courses.
