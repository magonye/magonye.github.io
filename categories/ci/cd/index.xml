      <description>Some time ago other team was managing the pipeline of my team&amp;rsquo;s applications, and they were also testing and deploying our applications.
This separation of responsibility between creating the software and making it run was leading us to:
 No ownership of the deployment process: feeling of non responsibility within the team. Errors on environments: No visibility of where our code was being deployed was producing sometimes problems with configuration on environments, and they were tough to fix.</description>
