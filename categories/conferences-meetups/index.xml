      <description>On 7th and 8th October, it took place the Software Craftsmanship Barcelona 2017 conference. It was my first time at the conference, that was celebrating its 5th edition. I had a great experience there!!
Software Craftsmanship There are really a lot of definitions of what is Software Craftsmanship, on Wikipedia there is a extensive definition, but I would like to write what Mash told me once:
 Software Craftsmanship is all about learning and teaching</description>

      <description>On 19th, 20th and 21st of June, I assisted to JBCNConf2017 with two colleagues. For me was the second time, as I assisted to JBCNConf last year.
In this post, I will try to explain you a little what is JBCNConf, why it&amp;rsquo;s important to assist to conferences, and how was my experience at this conference.
I know that I&amp;rsquo;m late, because I&amp;rsquo;m writing this on August and the conference was on June, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss the opportunity to write about JBCNConf, and payback something to the conference in return, as I learned a lot of things there.</description>
