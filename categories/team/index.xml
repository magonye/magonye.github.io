&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://magonye.github.io/img/colbookclub.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;COL: BookClub&#34; title=&#34;COL: Book Club&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading books is one of the activities everyone who is interested in software should do. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to learn new things, new points of view, new theories or practices. There are several books that every developer should read. But sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get time to read it, you  aren&amp;rsquo;t motivated enough, or even if you are reading the book, the book is hard to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By reading a book in a Book Club, you will discover a new way of learning from a book. Let’s see how we’re organizing our book club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition of Book Club&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Book Club&lt;/strong&gt; is a group of people that is reading the same book at the same time. There are regular meetings, and a list of chapters to read for the next scheduled meeting. You can read more about book clubs &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_discussion_club&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-we-started-it&#34;&gt;How we started it&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried with no success to read several tech books in the past. Most of them where very famous, as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code&#34;&gt;Clean Code&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/&#34;&gt;Robert C. Martin&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387190.Test_Driven_Development&#34;&gt;Test Driven Development: By Example&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kentbeck&#34;&gt;Kent Beck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never finished &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code&#34;&gt;Clean Code&lt;/a&gt;, although I tried three times. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find the motivation to read it, although I think it&amp;rsquo;s a brilliant book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t finish &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387190.Test_Driven_Development&#34;&gt;Test Driven Development: By Example&lt;/a&gt;. I thought I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really getting everything from the book. I was missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d heard about book clubs, a different way to read a book. I talked with some fellows, and starting this activity was easy: we picked a book everyone wanted to read (the first one was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23215733-the-software-craftsman&#34;&gt;The Software Craftsman&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://codurance.com/publications/author/sandro-mancuso/&#34;&gt;Sandro Mancuso&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-we-do-it&#34;&gt;How we do it&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We choose a book to read, and find people interested on read this book. We start with the first 2 or 3 chapters, depending the length of them, and we schedule a meeting to review the chapters. The meeting is regular, every two weeks usually. On the meeting, everybody talks about the chapters. There is no agenda for the meeting, just trying to share our thoughts and doubts about the book. At the end of the meeting, we choose the next chapters, and we schedule the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;rsquo;m happily reading two books at the same time within a book club: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/560861.Non_Violent_Communication&#34;&gt;Non Violent Communication&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Rosenberg&#34;&gt;Marshall B. Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month&#34;&gt;The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks&#34;&gt;Frederick P. Brooks Jr&lt;/a&gt;. And we have a huge list of &amp;ldquo;want-to-read&amp;rdquo; books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that we didn&amp;rsquo;t start any &amp;ldquo;really&amp;rdquo; technical book. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure this kind of books will work with a book club as we are doing. Besides the book club, we are reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4268826-growing-object-oriented-software-guided-by-tests&#34;&gt;Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sf105&#34;&gt;Steve Freeman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.natpryce.com/&#34;&gt;Nat Pryce&lt;/a&gt;. But we&amp;rsquo;re reading separate chapters, and guided by &lt;a href=&#34;https://codurance.com/publications/author/raquel-m%20carmena/&#34;&gt;Rachel M. Carmena&lt;/a&gt;, a Software Craftsperson embedded in our team. This kind of books, that every single page is really full of concepts, need a different &amp;ldquo;tempo&amp;rdquo;, and you need to digest and understand what is inside every page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-bring-us&#34;&gt;What bring us&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Book Club is growing my list of read software books. I&amp;rsquo;ve read some books within the club, that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have read by myself. And that&amp;rsquo;s this way because the Book Club has amazing things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gives you the motivation of reading a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It allows you to ask questions about the book to other readers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gives you different points of view about the same topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes you feel part of a community, with a same purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gives you a pace to read a book, neither slower nor faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone can bring you light on a part of the book that maybe you read too fast or you didn&amp;rsquo;t understand so deep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more reasons, but the above written, for me are good enough to start a Book Club at your company, or with a group of people you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;acknowledgments&#34;&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank &lt;a href=&#34;https://codurance.com/publications/author/sandro-mancuso/&#34;&gt;Sandro Mancuso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://codurance.com/publications/author/mashooq-badar/&#34;&gt;Mashooq Badar&lt;/a&gt; for the tremendous motivation they gave us at the beginning of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I want to thank my first partners at our book club, without you, this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been possible: Jordi Farré, Joaquín Caro, Marc Villagrasa, Erik Torres, Alvaro García and Joan Carles Pallás. Thank you, I love you all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I want to thank &lt;a href=&#34;https://codurance.com/publications/author/raquel-m%20carmena/&#34;&gt;Rachel M. Carmena&lt;/a&gt; for her patience, guidance, mentoring, revision and correction of my posts.

      <title>Culture Of Learning: Lunch and Learn</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://magonye.github.io/img/collunchandlearn.png&#34; alt=&#34;COL: Lunch and Learn&#34; title=&#34;COL: Lunch and Learn&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this year we are experiencing a very huge transformation as a team. We are living an interesting journey to become a more mature team, an autonomous team inside the company. And this transformation includes a lot of practices and activities. With this series of posts, that I&amp;rsquo;ll call &lt;strong&gt;Culture of Learning&lt;/strong&gt;, I will try to explain in detail each of these activities, how we started them, how we do them and what they give us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the first post of this series is about our Lunch and Learn sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lunch-and-learn&#34;&gt;Lunch and Learn&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the first activities the team started a few months ago. Lunch and Learn (L&amp;amp;L from now) is basically a meal time that we spend together, in a room, and learning some technical stuff, not related to our current tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-we-started-it&#34;&gt;How we started it&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning  of this year, we had the amazing opportunity of working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://codurance.com/publications/author/sandro-mancuso/&#34;&gt;Sandro Mancuso&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://codurance.com/publications/author/mashooq-badar/&#34;&gt;Mashooq Badar&lt;/a&gt;, founders of &lt;a href=&#34;https://codurance.com/&#34;&gt;Codurance&lt;/a&gt;. We spent intensive weeks, reviewing all our applications together, and redesigning how they should be. We got a very close relationship, and we also had to spend lunch time together talking about several things. One of these things was how we could be a better team. They talked us about some kind of
Tech Lunch they did in the past. They told us that if we wanted to learn something, a good idea is to spend the meal time learning it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This activity was very easy to start. If you have an available room and some people with anger to learn, that&amp;rsquo;s all! So, on 19th of April we had the first session of our L&amp;amp;L: it was a kata about Docker. Since then, we have enjoyed 16 sessions, and they have been about several topics, such as &lt;em&gt;Json Web Tokens&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cucumber&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Clean Architecture&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Git&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tech Debt&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;OWASP guide&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Java 8 Streams and Lambdas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-we-do-it&#34;&gt;How we do it&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, basically you only need a room, and people that want to learn something together. You choose a topic or topics to talk about: a video about some interesting topic, a kata, topics to discuss, a workshop, or any relevant tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require a big effort to prepare a L&amp;amp;L session, even we had a session with no topic, and we just talked about several subjects, as an open space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activity lasts 2 hours, one is our meal time, and another hour from our work time. We give one personal hour and the company gives the other hour, it&amp;rsquo;s a 50-50 balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do this activity weekly, every Wednesday, from 13:00 to 15:00. Each session can be facilitated by one or more people, and we try to fix the agenda for the next session one week before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a page on our Confluence team space, where we track all sessions, speakers, and topics. Some topics can be covered in a single session. Other topics can end with a challenge. It&amp;rsquo;s an exercise for everybody or an exercise for each member. They are totally volunteer, no one in the team is forced neither to assist to a meeting nor to resolve a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-bring-us&#34;&gt;What bring us&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L&amp;amp;L for us is a safe place where we can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn things&lt;/strong&gt;: It&amp;rsquo;s a good place to start some technology. If someone in the team has curiosity for any topic, no matter which, he can manage a session there. He can be an expert or not, he can be a teacher or a student as the others: the important thing is to learn something together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expose your doubts&lt;/strong&gt;: You can talk with your colleagues with humbleness, nobody is judging, there is no managers, only buddies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train our communicative skills&lt;/strong&gt;: Not everybody is open and talkative, and some programmers are introverts. At the L&amp;amp;L anyone can manage a session, alone or with someone. Every member has facilitated at least one session, and our communicative skills are improving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;: If someone learns something, no matter how big or important it is, it could be shared as a session. We have learned and shared a lot of different tech stuff, and it could be very difficult to learn so many things by our own. Sharing is key, in order to be more broad at our learning topics, as different members are interested on different topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;acknowledgments&#34;&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to thank Mash and Sandro for the inspiration. Without their advice and wise words, this change wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to thank &lt;a href=&#34;https://codurance.com/publications/author/alvaro-garcia/&#34;&gt;Alvaro García&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://codurance.com/publications/author/raquel-m%20carmena/&#34;&gt;Rachel M. Carmena&lt;/a&gt;, both craftspeople at &lt;a href=&#34;https://codurance.com&#34;&gt;Codurance&lt;/a&gt;, and embedded at our team when L&amp;amp;L was started. They helped us a lot, facilitating our first sessions, and proposing topics for next sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will talk more about &lt;strong&gt;Culture of Learning&lt;/strong&gt; in following posts. If you liked it, or you have doubts, please, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any feedback will be very appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
