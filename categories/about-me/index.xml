      <description>Mike Gonzalez Software Engineer since 2000: I&#39;ve been a bored (also boring, I guess...) Java developer for many many years. I made my job, without caring my methodology or skills. I wasn&#39;t concerned about doing my job with professionalism neither enthusiasm.
Father of two incredible kids: Adri√† and Claudia.
Runner and free athlete: I think we should care also our body and health, as we care our mind and skills.</description>
