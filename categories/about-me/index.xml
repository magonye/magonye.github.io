      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for international companies for more than two years. It has been a great experience, and I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed more than expected working for these kind of companies.
 DISCLAIMER 1: I know that some or all the points could be found in a national company, but I never did it before. This post is based on my own experience. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to say that all internation companies are better than national ones, or that you can live the same experience I did just by joining any random company.</description>

      <title>Building Habits</title>

      <description>One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that it&amp;rsquo;s very tough for many people is to build habits that last in time, and become part of our life. Everyone probably knows what they should be doing, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be anything tech-related, it could be also some lifestyle activity, such as reading or practicing any kind of sport.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also found it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to maintain habits through time, so I&amp;rsquo;ll share with you the things that are working for me, and maybe you could also adopt.</description>

      <description>I’ve been working almost for 6 years at the same employer. It’s been the longest period in my professional career. When you are trying to get features to production quickly within a team, and at the same time learning new things and trying to refactor and improve your architecture, most of the time you don’t realize about how fast time happens.
But then, something happens. Maybe it is a teammate that leave the team (you know who you are, don’t you?</description>

      <description>Mike Gonzalez Software Engineer since 2000: I&#39;ve been a bored (also boring, I guess...) Java developer for many many years. I made my job, without caring my methodology or skills. I wasn&#39;t concerned about doing my job with professionalism neither enthusiasm.
Father of two incredible kids: Adrià and Claudia.
Runner and free athlete: I think we should care also our body and health, as we care our mind and skills.</description>
